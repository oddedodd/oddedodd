## Hi there 👋 My Name is Odd Egil Hegge Selnes

Front End Developer 🧑‍💻 | Graphic Designer 🧑‍🎨
------------------------------

Hello and welcome to my humble GitHub profile!

I’ve just completed my first year of Front End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, and it’s been an exciting journey. My passion for web and graphic design dates back to the nineties, and in the early 2000s, I was deep into PHP development. However, I took a break from the profession for a few years, only to return to a landscape that had completely transformed.

Nowadays, I work as a web developer and graphic designer for my local newspaper. To keep up with the fast-paced advancements in technology, I decided to dive back into studying, focusing on front end development. This has not only refreshed my skills but also introduced me to the latest tools and techniques that are shaping the future of web development.

Feel free to explore my projects, and let’s embark on this coding adventure together!
