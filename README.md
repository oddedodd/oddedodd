## Hi there 👋 My Name is Odd Egil Hegge Selnes

Front End Developer 🧑‍💻 | Graphic Designer 🧑‍🎨
------------------------------

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a front-end developer and graphic designer based in Namsos, Norway, currently working at Namdalsavisa. I recently graduated from the Front-End Development program at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, and it’s been an incredible journey of growth and rediscovery.

My passion for design and code goes way back — all the way to the ’90s. In the early 2000s, I was heavily into PHP development before taking a break from tech for a few years. Coming back, I found a web landscape transformed by modern tools like React, Tailwind CSS, and headless CMS platforms — and I couldn’t wait to dive in.

Through my studies and professional work, I’ve developed a deep interest in component-based architecture, responsive design, and building user-friendly digital experiences. I’m especially passionate about bridging the gap between design and code — bringing creative ideas to life through clean, maintainable front-end development.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to connect!
